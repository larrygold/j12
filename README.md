Hello everyone,

This is our group project dividing in few exercices : 


1. Scrapping datas from french townhalls
2. Senging emails to townhalls
3. Listing all the twitter townhalls accounts
4. Working on differents branchs in the same time


A gemfile was created with all the gems to install and the ruby version to use.

To get the different keys access and as Dotenv wasn't working well, please write to one of us on Slack to get the codes.

To get access to the spreadsheet :
